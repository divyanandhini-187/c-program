## 🧩 C Programming Foundation – Practice Repository
## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a structured collection of C programming practice programs created to build a strong foundation in C.
The programs are organized in a progressive, level-based format, starting from fundamental concepts and moving toward advanced topics.

The primary focus of this repository is to strengthen core C concepts required for embedded systems and low-level programming.

## 🧠 Learning Methodology

✔ Concept-driven learning
✔ Step-by-step difficulty progression
✔ Emphasis on memory, logic, and structure
✔ Practical problem-solving approach

Each level reinforces previously learned concepts while introducing new ones.

## 📂 Repository Organization
